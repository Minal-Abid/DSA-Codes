Project Overview:
This project is a Capture The Flag (CTF) platform consisting of a backend API, a frontend client application, a server setup, and shared database schema definitions. 
It supports user authentication, challenge management, flag submissions, and admin functionalities.

- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md: Markdown file summarizing implementation details or project notes.
- manual_challenges_inserts.sql: SQL script for manual insertion of challenge data into the database.
- package.json: Node.js project manifest listing dependencies, scripts, and project metadata.
- package.json.patch: Patch file for package.json, possibly for dependency updates or fixes.
- package-lock.json: Automatically generated file locking exact versions of Node.js dependencies.
- postcss.config.js: Configuration for PostCSS, a CSS processing tool.
- README.md: Project readme file with overview, setup instructions, and documentation.
- replit.md: Documentation or notes specific to Replit environment usage.
- setup.sh: Shell script for setting up the project environment or dependencies.
- tailwind.config.ts: Configuration file for Tailwind CSS framework.
- tsconfig.json: TypeScript compiler configuration file.
- vite.config.ts: Configuration file for Vite build tool and development server.

1. Backend (backend/app.py and related files):
- app.py: Main Flask backend API server handling user authentication, challenge management, flag submissions, and admin routes.
- setup_db.py: Script to initialize or reset the database schema and tables.
- requirements.txt: Lists Python dependencies required for the backend.
- uploads/: Directory to store uploaded files.
- error.log: Log file capturing backend errors.

2. Client (client/ directory):
- index.html: Main HTML entry point for the React frontend.
- src/App.tsx: Main React app component setting up routing, context providers, and UI utilities.
- src/index.css: Global CSS styles for the frontend.
- src/main.tsx: React app bootstrap file.
- src/components/: Contains React UI components such as forms, dashboards, leaderboards, navigation bars, and reusable UI elements.
- src/components/ui/: Collection of smaller UI components like buttons, inputs, dialogs, and tooltips.
- src/contexts/: React context providers like AuthContext for managing authentication state.
- src/hooks/: Custom React hooks for functionality like mobile detection and toast notifications.
- src/lib/: Utility libraries including query client setup and helper functions.
- src/pages/: React page components like Home, AdminDashboard, and NotFound.
- src/types/: TypeScript type definitions used across the frontend.

3. Server (server/ directory):
- index.ts: Express server entry point setting up middleware, routes, error handling, and Vite integration.
- routes.ts: Defines API routes and handlers for the server.
- storage.ts: Handles file storage and related utilities.
- vite.ts: Configures Vite development server and static file serving.

4. Shared (shared/schema.ts):
- Defines database table schemas using Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL.
- Includes Zod schemas for input validation and TypeScript types for entities.
- Tables: users, challenges, submissions.
- Interface for leaderboard entries.

5. Attached Assets (attached_assets/ directory):
- Contains various .tsx files and configuration files, possibly older or backup frontend assets.

Use Cases:
- Users can register, login, view and submit CTF challenges.
- Admins can manage users, challenges, and upload files.
- The frontend provides an interactive UI for users to participate in challenges.
- The server acts as a middleware layer handling requests and serving the client.
- Shared schema ensures consistent database structure and validation.

This explanation covers the main files and their purposes, providing a comprehensive understanding of the project structure and functionality.
